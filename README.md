Summary of Netflix Dataset Code File

In this code file, we performed a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing of the Netflix dataset, which contains information about various movies and TV shows available on the platform. The main steps undertaken in the code are as follows:

1. Data Loading: We began by loading the Netflix dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. Missing Value Handling: We identified and addressed missing values in key columns such as 'director', 'cast', and 'country' by filling them with appropriate placeholders (e.g., 'Unknown' or 'Not Specified').

3. Duplicate Removal: We checked for and removed any duplicate rows in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

4. Text Standardization: We standardized text values in columns such as 'rating' and 'type' by converting them to lowercase and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.

5. Date Format Conversion: We converted the 'date_added' column to a datetime format, ensuring that any leading or trailing whitespace was removed prior to conversion. This allows for easier date manipulation and analysis.

6. Column Renaming: We renamed the columns to follow a consistent naming convention by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.

7. Data Type Verification: We ensured that the 'release_year' column was of integer type and that other relevant columns were in the correct format for analysis.

8. Data Quality Checks: We filtered the dataset to include only valid ratings and customer types, ensuring that the data is clean and reliable for further analysis.

9. Documentation of Changes: We documented the changes made during the cleaning process in a summary dictionary, providing a clear overview of the modifications.

10. Output: Finally, we displayed the cleaned dataset and saved it to a new CSV file for future use.
